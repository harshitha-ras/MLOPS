Compliance Summary Report
--------------------------

System: SmartEnterprise AI Suite
Version: v1.0

Responsible AI Features Implemented:
------------------------------------

✔️ Prompt filtering with blocked keyword list  
✔️ Output sanitization post-generation  
✔️ Privacy redaction (emails, phone numbers)  
✔️ Full prompt/response audit logging  
✔️ Caching with prompt hash only (no raw PII stored)  
✔️ No cloud APIs or third-party inference endpoints used  
✔️ All AI runs fully offline on local CPU (GGUF model)  

Data Handling & Privacy:
------------------------
- No personal data stored unless entered by user into prompt
- Generated outputs are filtered to remove contact info
- All logs stored locally, not sent externally

Risk Areas Mitigated:
---------------------
- Prompt injection ➝ via input sanitization  
- Toxic/unsafe output ➝ via post-filtering  
- PII leakage ➝ via redaction filters  
- Undocumented model behavior ➝ via full audit logging

Suggested Future Work:
-----------------------
- Add login session tracking and user IDs in audit
- Add rate-limiting to prevent abuse
- Add model disclaimer banner to CLI/UI

Conclusion:
-----------
The system meets baseline standards for responsible use,
transparency, and local data handling. Suitable for internal
enterprise or demo usage under responsible oversight.
