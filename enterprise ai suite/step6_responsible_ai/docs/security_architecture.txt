Security Architecture - SmartEnterprise AI Suite
-------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
This document outlines the security and privacy design
implemented across the AI Suite, focusing on:

- Content filtering
- Prompt/response sanitization
- Audit logging
- Privacy redaction

1. Input Filtering:
-------------------
- File: filters.py
- Checks for dangerous keywords such as: "kill", "abuse", "suicide"
- Blocks unsafe prompts before generation
- Ensures AI output is only generated for safe, acceptable content

2. Output Sanitization:
-----------------------
- Replaces unsafe or blocked words in AI output with [filtered]
- Ensures no unexpected or toxic text leaks into the UI/API

3. Privacy Protection:
----------------------
- Redacts phone numbers and email addresses in generated output
- File: privacy.py
- Ensures user PII is never exposed by the AI or stored in logs

4. Audit Logging:
-----------------
- All interactions are logged in audit_log.jsonl
- Fields: timestamp, prompt, response, source (cli/ui/api), safety flag
- Helps ensure accountability and traceability

5. API-Level Security:
----------------------
- No external access by default (localhost only)
- Can be protected by proxy auth if exposed externally

6. CLI & Dashboard Trust Model:
-------------------------------
- All local tools log prompts and outputs
- Real-time filtering/sanitization integrated in backend, not UI

Conclusion:
-----------
This layered approach balances usability with responsible AI
design. Safety nets are placed before generation, after generation,
and in storage/logging layers.
