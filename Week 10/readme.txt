TextGen AI: Responsible AI & Security Implementation
Overview
This project is a secure, responsible text generation API built with FastAPI and HuggingFace Transformers. It demonstrates responsible AI practices, robust security controls, privacy protection, audit logging, and compliance documentation as required by the assignment.

Features
API Key Authentication: Protects endpoints from unauthorized access.

Input Validation & Sanitization: Prevents malicious input and injection attacks.

Privacy Controls: Pseudonymizes user identifiers and avoids storing sensitive data.

Audit Logging: Logs all access attempts (success/failure) with hashed user IDs and metadata.

Exception Handling: Prevents leakage of sensitive error information.

Environment Variable Secrets: Keeps API keys and other secrets out of source code.

Compliance-Ready: Designed with GDPR/CCPA and security best practices in mind.

Setup & Usage
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
2. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers
3. Set the API Key
Set your API key as an environment variable before starting the server:

bash
export SECRET_API_KEY=1234
4. Run the Server
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
5. Make a Request
Use curl or any HTTP client:

bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "X-API-Key: 1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello world", "user_id":"testuser"}'
Security Architecture
Authentication: Every request must include a valid X-API-Key header. The server compares this to the environment variable SECRET_API_KEY.

Input Validation: All incoming data is validated using Pydantic models, with length limits and type checks to prevent injection and abuse.

Audit Logging: Each request is logged with timestamp, endpoint, hashed user ID, input length, and status (success/error). No raw prompts or generated text are stored, protecting user privacy.

Exception Handling: All errors are caught and generic messages are returned to avoid leaking sensitive system details.

Environment Variables: Secrets like the API key are never hardcoded, reducing risk of accidental exposure.

HTTPS Recommendation: For production, always run behind HTTPS to protect data in transit.

Privacy Controls
User Pseudonymization: User IDs are SHA-256 hashed in logs, so no direct personal information is stored or processed.

No Sensitive Data Storage: The system does not store prompts, generated texts, or any PII.

Input Size Limiting: Restricts input length to minimize risk of data exfiltration or abuse.

Compliance with Privacy Regulations: Designed to align with GDPR/CCPA by minimizing data retention and ensuring transparency in data handling.

Audit System
What is Logged:

Timestamp

Endpoint accessed

Hashed user identifier

Input length

Status (success, error type)

Sample Log Entry:

text
2025-06-23 18:00:00 - Endpoint: /generate, UserHash: a9d3c8f..., InputLength: 42, Status: success
Log Storage: Logs are written to audit.log in the project directory. No sensitive or identifying information is stored.

Compliance Report
Risk Assessment: No PII is stored; user IDs are pseudonymized. Input is validated and sanitized to prevent abuse.

Access Control: API key authentication restricts access to authorized users only.

Monitoring & Logging: All access attempts are logged for traceability and incident response.

Policy Enforcement: Only requests with a valid API key and valid input schema are processed. All others are rejected with appropriate error codes.

Continuous Improvement: The system is designed to be extensible for additional controls such as rate limiting, content moderation, and real-time monitoring.

Best Practices Reference
Authentication & Authorization: Use API keys or OAuth2 for endpoint protection.

Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize input, especially for user-generated content.

Audit Logging: Log all requests for security and compliance, but avoid storing sensitive data.

Privacy by Design: Minimize data collection, pseudonymize identifiers, and avoid PII storage.

Compliance: Map controls to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant frameworks.

Secure Secrets: Use environment variables for all secrets and keys.

HTTPS: Always use HTTPS in production to protect data in transit.
